report should have two modes, 'lines' and 'table' (or 'totals')

init: do a full report (subject to last six months, table mode), then
enter query loop.  Replace report() with a Report call, and use the
existing code in report() to implement table mode.


replace expense2string, @field_order with Expense.pm

fix bug regarding added codes being entered as strings 

monthly totals in report

separate io loop from query generator
* have two occasions to read from the terminal and do stuff:
** assigning codes to unknown expenses
*** hard to use Term::Shell because *all* cmds will essentially be unknown
*** so better to keep existing system?
** generating reports
*** might have potential to use Term::Shell; cmds might be:
**** c \d+
**** s mm/dd/yy
**** e mm/dd/yy
**** q
****
