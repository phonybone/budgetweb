Continue testing removal of dups; have to figure out good test
strategy.

Insertion into test db shows many fields are still strings, not
numbers.  Fix this.

Need to setup a fixture for testing

report should have two modes, 'lines' and 'table' (or 'totals')

init: do a full report (subject to last six months, table mode), then
enter query loop.  Replace report() with a Report call, and use the
existing code in report() to implement table mode.


replace expense2string, @field_order with Expense.pm

fix bug regarding added codes being entered as strings 

monthly totals in report

separate io loop from query generator

# read codes (store codes in db?)
# 
# read data files
# - strip quotes
# - weed out bad lines
# - convert amounts
# - convert dates
# - convert alphanumeric codes to numbers, store to db
# insert data 

# build report hash (by_month_by_code)
# do reports
